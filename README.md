I am just releasing .deb's, nothing more.

Linux kernel with
- **WINE FSYNC Kernel Patch** for better performance on WINE/Proton
- **PDS CPU Scheduler**, really good CPU scheduler for gaming
- Other optimizations for gaming.
- Configured specifically for Ryzen processors

Check **Releases** to get .deb files for Ubuntu 20.04 with Headers.

Don't forget to run *sudo update-initramfs -u* after installing both .deb files
